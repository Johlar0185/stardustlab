            I am Norma, a Fashion and Jewelry designer based in Copenhagen.
            <br /><br />
            I started sewing my bikinis back 2013 when I won my class in Bikini
            Fitness. Since then I became passionate about improving my physique
            and presentation. And so I did until reaching top 6 at European
            Championships.
            <br /><br />
            My mission is to create the winner look that works for you. I know
            all the tricks and rules on how to make the best out of your
            physique. I can help choosing the colors, the cut and the design to
            maximize your chances of success, and I am aware of all
            international trends and classes.
